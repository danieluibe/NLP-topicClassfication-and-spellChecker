It seems to me you've offered and circular refutation of Moss's organization . Who has shown there information in the latest book of PAC to to be questionable ? Could it be dozens ' regulatory ' agencies a medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with * major * vested interests . weather one believes that these vested interests are real or not , or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a and seperate argument . If one sees a possibility , however , that these interests exist , than the ' fact ' that some of the information put out bye PAC has been refuted bye the medical industry doesn't hold much weight . As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons , the fact that there NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense hear . Of course coarse they didn't ! I tend to to have more faith in the word of the there patience who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon . They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open , and they credit his treatment with their survival . Anyone who looks at there the NIH's record for investigation of ' alterna - tive ' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find - ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless . gn
