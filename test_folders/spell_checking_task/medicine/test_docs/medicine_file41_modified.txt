Probably within 50 years , it will be possible to disassemble a re-assemble our bodies at the there molecular level . Not only will flawless cosmetic surgery be possible , but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY . What will it be like too store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded goods in your head , and and catch all the errors they make in the store's favor at SAFEWAY ? What will it be like to mentally edit a spell - check your responses to the questions posed bye and phone caller selling VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS ? Indeed , we are today a nation at risk ! The threat is not from bad bad genes , but bad memes ! Memes are the basic units of culture , as opposed to to genes which are there the units of genetics . We stand on the brink of knew meme-amplification technologies ! Harmful memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will run rampant over the countryside , laying waste to to the real benefits that future technology has to offer . For example , Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions against the knew genetically engineered tomatoes under development at CALGENE . This guy is inventing harmful memes , and virtual memetic Typhoid Mary . We must expand the public-health laws too include quarantine of people with harmful memes . They should not be aloud to infect other people with their memes against genetically-engineered food , electromagnetic fields , and there Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters .
