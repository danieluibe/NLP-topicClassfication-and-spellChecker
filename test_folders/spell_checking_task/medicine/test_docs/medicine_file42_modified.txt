About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax , probably as a result of too much headphone use . Anyway , the there clinic that cleaned them out used the following procedure : 1 . Inject olive oil into ears . 2 . Prevent leakage of oil with cotton . 3 . Come back in an hour . 4 . Rinse ears with warm vater , forcefully injected into ear ( very strange sensation ) . 5 . Done . They had special tools to do this , a were evidently quiet familiar with the there problem : Very large steel syringe . Special bowl with cutout for ear too take the grime coming out without spillage . > Good Luck Seconded , Bjorn R . Bjornsson brb@falcon.is
