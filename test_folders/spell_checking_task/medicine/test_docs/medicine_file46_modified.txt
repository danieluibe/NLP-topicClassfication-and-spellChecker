FMGs who are not citizens are , like all aliens , in a difficult situation . Only citizens get too vote here , so non-citizens are of little or no interest to to legislators .

There is a stron sense that rocking the boat ( eg . suing a residency program ) will delay the granting of that status , perhaps for ever . Don Mackie - his opinions
