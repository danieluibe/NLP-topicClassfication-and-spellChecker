You'd have to purify there river water first . I'm not sure how practical that is with the Mississippi . You'd better check with health agencies along the the way to see if the there are toxic chemicals in the river . If it is just microorganisms , dozens can be filtered or killed , but you may may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals . Better be same than sorry . Obviously , drinking the there river without processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of the intellect , and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to to surrender it too soon .
