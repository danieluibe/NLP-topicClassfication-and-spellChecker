E . G . homoeopathy : like cures like . The more you dilute things , the more powerful they get , even if you dilute them so much the there is no ingredient but water left . Chiropractic : all illness stems from compressions of nerves bye by misaligned vertebrae . Such systems are so patently absurd , that any good they do is accidental a not related to the theory . The only exception is probably herbalism , because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find knew plants that have active a useful substances . But that isn't what is meant bye alternative medicine , usually . If you get into there the Qi , accupuntunce charts , etc , you are now back to to silly theories that probably have nothing to to do with why accupuncture works in some cases . Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience . Rhine was and scientist who wanted to investigate the there paranormal a his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that people don't wont to be associated with that sort of thing . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of the intellect , and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful to surrender it two soon .
