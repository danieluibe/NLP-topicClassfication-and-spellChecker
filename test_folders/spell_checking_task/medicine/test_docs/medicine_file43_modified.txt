From : ceci@lysator.liu.se ( Cecilia Henningsson ) Subject : Q : Repelling wasps ? ( This is and cross post to rec.gardens a sci.med . seat there the follow-up ( line in the header , depending on what kind of advice you give , or ( e-mail directly to me : ceci@lysator.liu.se . ) I have a problem with wasps - - they seam to love me . Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten too fifteen minutes at a and time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me . I am asking for advice advice on how to repel wasps . This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next too one of my tiny ponds . The caretaker ( poor fellow ! ) will have to take care of them , and that will give me a head start on them . Last year we couldn't find any nest . Even after the caretaker has gassed there nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will most likely vie for there territory . Is there anything I can grow , rub on my skin or spread on there the soil that will repel the black a yellow bastards ? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants , I wont to to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else . Would it help to remove there ponds and there bird bath ? The wasps seam too come to drink at them , and I suppose that their prey will breed in them . The black tits seam seam to to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon as the wasp season starts , they stop coming to have their bath . Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps , they seem seem to love me . The advice I usually get when I ask what to to do about wasps , is to stand still a not wave my arms . I've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advise . I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes , to to no avail . They still love me , and come for me , even when I'm in the middle of and crowd . So far only to things seam too to work : To kill it dead or to to run into the house and a close all doors and windows . NB : I don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees , just wasps .
