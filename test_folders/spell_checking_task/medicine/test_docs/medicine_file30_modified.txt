From : bj368@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Mike E . Romano ) Subject : hone Medical Tests I am looking for current currant sources for lists of all the hone medical tests currently legally available . I believe this trend of allowing tests at hone where feasible , decreased medical costs bye by and factor of 10 or more a allows the patient some time and and privacy to consider the best action from there results of such tests . In fact I belief hone medical tests a certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer , heart disease , should be offered free to the the American public . This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have and earlier opportunity to know about a and work toward recuperation or cure .
