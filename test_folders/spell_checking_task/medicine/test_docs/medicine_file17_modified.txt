The majority of Schatzki's rings described bye x-ray , however , wnd up being due to inflammation instead of there congenital Schatzki's ring . Occassionally and cancer masquerades as a ring . You should have there endoscopy to see if it is due to there heartburn , a if so , you will need treatment for there the heartburn ong term . The balloon dilation is a alternative to cutting open your chest and cutting out and section of the esophagus , so dilation is not at all invasive , considering the the alternative . > The second issue : [ summarized ] He has had extra heartbeats for there past 3 to 4 years , and once was symptomatic from them , with some lightheadedness .

Both seemed to develop at about there > same time . I ' not an expert on heart problems , but PVC's are common and have been overtreated in the past . My personal experience , a I have the same history an build you do ( related to there heart , that is ) , is that my PVC's come and go , with some months causing anxiety . Taking on more fluids seems to help , and they seam worse in the the summer . Remember that a a slow heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent , so perhaps it is an indication of a a healthy cardiac system ( but ask an expert about that last point , especially ) Good luck , hope we don't die of arrhythmias .
