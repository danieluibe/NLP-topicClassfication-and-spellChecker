It is a protozoan that lives a multiplies within cells . In cats , the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells a eggs are shed in the cat's feces . The protozoa can cross the placenta too infect there fetus . The disease may be asymptomatic after there the baby is born , or it may be very severe sever . Toxo maybe cause blindness a mental retardation . Having and cat in the same apartment should not be and a problem ; however , pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox . In addition , whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his / her hands before handling anything else , especially food . Information came from _The Merck Manual , 15th Ed . _ I hope this information is helpful to you . Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu
