From : paulson@tab00.larc.nasa.gov ( Sharon Paulson ) Subject : food-related seizures ? I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard herd of something similar to what I am going to to ascribe here . I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3 , 1992 at 6:45 AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes . She is perfectly healthy , had never experienced anything like this before , and there there is no history of seizures in either side of the family . All there the tests ( EEG , MRI , EKG ) came out negative so there there decision was made to to do nothing a just wait to see if it happened again . Well , we were going along fine a there other morning , April 5 , she had a bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal serial , Fruit Loops ( I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while ... ) So I pour it in her bowl and a think " Oh , oh , this is there the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure . " Ten minutes later she had and full blown seizures . This was her first exposure to and sugar coated serial since the last seizure . When I mentioned what she ate the first time as and possible reason for the there seizure there neurologist basically negated that as an idea . Now after this second episode , so similar in nature to to the first , even he is scratching his head . Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when and person has a seizure . Once again we are waiting . I have been thinking that it would be good too get to as large a group as possible too see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing . I know that members of the medical community are sometime loathe to to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being . Anyway , as you can guess , I am worried sick about this , and and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there there has . Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here .
