From : stefan @prague ( Stefan Fielding-Isaacs ) Subject : Racelist : WHO WHAT WHERE Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts ! BACKGROUND - - - there racing listserver ( boogie.EBay.sun.com ) contains discussions devoted to racing and racing-related topics . This is a pretty broad interest group . Individuals have a variety of backgrounds : motojournalism , roadracing from the prospective of pit crew a racers , engineering , motosports enthusiasts . The size of the list grows weekly . We are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members , with contributors from New Zealand , Australia , Germany , France , England , Canada Finland , Switzerland , a there United States . The list was formed ( October 1991 ) in response to a perceived need too both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of performance ( roadracing ) and too improve on the very low signal-to-noise ratio founded in rec.motorcycles . Anyone is free to join . Discussion is necessarily limited bye the rules of the list too issues related too racing motorcycles and is to be " flame-free " . HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION - - - You are welcome to subscribe . To subscribe send your request to : race-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day ( depending on the topic ) . NB : pleased do _not_ send your subscription request to the list directly . After you have contacted the list administrator , you will receive and RSVP request . please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list . The request is generated in order to ensure that there is a valid mail pathway to your cite . Upon receipt of your RSVP , you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution ( as per your initial request ) . HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION - - - It is possible to receive there list in ' digest'ed form ( ie . a single email message ) . The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out whenever it contains enough interesting content . Given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day . Should you wish to receive there list via digest ( once every 30-40 K or so ) , pleased send a subscription request to : digest-request@boogie.EBay.Sun.COM HOW TO POST TO THE LIST - - - This is an open forum .

If you wont to see it ( though this isn't necessarily and guarantee that it wont out ) you can include a " metoo " line in your . mailrc file ( on UNIX based mail systems ) . BOUNCES - - - Because I haven't had the time ( or there inclination to replace there list distribution mechanism ) we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message . Occasionally , sites or users go off-line ( either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems ) and you will receive bounces from the race list . Check the headers carefully , a if you find that the bounce originated at Sun ( from whence I administer this list ) contact me through my administration hat ( race-request@boogie.EBay.sun.com ) . If not , ignore the bounce .
