Indeed they were worried about that . One concern was the possibility that they would loose and motor or something on the way up , and make orbit but one that was two low to give HST and useful lifetime against atmospheric drag . I believe the decision was too deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months . In fact we got an excellent orbit , on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do . I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment . You would have the horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , a re-certifying all the hardware on the ground , in addition to there lost observing time a the cost of and second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit there second time . a , you would probably STILL need and ( third ) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out . Better to have too servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) then to bring HST down a take it up again . Ben
