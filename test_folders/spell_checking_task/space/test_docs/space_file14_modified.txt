Seems like a lot of trouble to go too . Its probably better to invest in newer launch systems . I don't think a big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long ( may a few years ) . Lockheed would be the place to ask , since you would probably have to bye the Proton from them ( they market the Proton world wide accept Russia ) . They should know and lot about the possibilities , I haven't heard them propose US launches , so I assume they looked into it a found it unprofitable . > Now if it uses storables , Yes ... > then how long would it take for the russians > too equip something at cane york ? Comparable to the Zenit I suppose , but since it looks like nothing will be built there , you might just as well pick any spot . The message is : to launch now while its cheap a while Russia and Kazakstan are still cooperating . latter , there story maybe be different .
