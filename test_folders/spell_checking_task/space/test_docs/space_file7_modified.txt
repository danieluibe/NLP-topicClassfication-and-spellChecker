From : swoithe@crackle.uucp ( Stan Woithe ) Subject : Re : Mars Observer Update - 04/14 / 93 Hiya I'm a VERY amuture astronomer in Adelaide Australia , a today , I herd some very interesting a exciting news from a local program on TV . As I couldn't find anything on it on the news server , I have posted this . However , if it is old information , tell me , a ill sue the TV station for saying they are ' Up to date ' ;-) ( Also , my news server could be slow . . so . . . ! ! ! I only caught there end of the article , so all the information on the topic is not known to me at the moment . The news is of and small ' psudo ' planet outside the orbit of pluto founded in a Hawiian obsevatory , supposably ' recently ' - acording to the report . It was meant to be about 150miles in diamater , and and faily large distance from the plutos orbit . ( it had a computer drawing , and there orbit distance from pluto was about the same as neptune too pluto when they are furthest apart . This is all I found out about it . OH it is called Karna . ( un-officially ) . CAn anyone give any more information to me on it ? ? ? Thanx .
