What I mean by " compositing " is , say I have a live video clip ( digitized ) panning around a living room , and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen . I want to combine these too series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black , I wont there living room picture to show through . Yes , I realize I can do this with a genlock , a I do own and genlock , but I wont to be able too do manual compositing also . It's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time ; I assumed I'd have to do that anyways . But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better . I've looked around a I haven't founded and PC package that will perform this . Help , pleased ! If you can get the live animation a the computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator . FLI or . FLC format , AutoDesk Animator will do this for you . It can take one animation , make a certain color " clear " , and overlay it over another animation . I do not have and way right now to convert . AVI or . MPG files to animator files . Animator will also import a series of . GIF files to create and animation , so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work . - Vance Gloster gloster@inference.com
