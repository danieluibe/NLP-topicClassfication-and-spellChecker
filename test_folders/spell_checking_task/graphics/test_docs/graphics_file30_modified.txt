OK , I don't use CView anymore , but I saw that no one had explaind this " bug " in the thread , so here goes : It is NOT the fault of CView . It is DOS ! If you leave a file open on a floppy drive , than change the disk and do something which updates or closes that file , you have a good chance of getting part of the directory a FAT from the other disk written too there new disk . This has always been true , and has destroyed data under other programs , not just CView . The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not too leave files open unless it's actively using them ( ie , reading and decoding ) . - - Kevin Martin sigma@rahul.net " I gotta get me another hat .
