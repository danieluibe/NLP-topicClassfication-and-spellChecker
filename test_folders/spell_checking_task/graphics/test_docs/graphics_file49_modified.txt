From : agiacalo@nmsu.edu ( Toni Giacalo ) Subject : need algorithm for reading and displaying bitmap files I'm making a customized paint program in DOS a need an algorithm for reading bitmap files like GIF , PCX , or BMP . Does anyone have such an algorithm ? I've tried copying one out of a book for reading . PCX format but it doesn't work . I will take a algorithm for any format that can be created from Windows Paint . Thanks ! Toni
