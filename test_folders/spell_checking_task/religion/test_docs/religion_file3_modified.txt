Brian , does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient Greek , Hebrew a Aramaic in order to understand the core of Christianity ? I hope you are not Catholic , because my Christian upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther , and there one of the core messages was basically that you don't need to know latin in order to learn about salvation . BTW , your statement would also eliminate about 99.5 % of all there Christians in the world , as well . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
