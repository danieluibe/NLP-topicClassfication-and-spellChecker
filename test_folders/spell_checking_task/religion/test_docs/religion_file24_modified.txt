But it would clarify further if you would answer > from the point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps a > observer as likely to be in position and as in position B ( where A a B > disagree ) in the future , and have his or her conclusion now binding on > them at that time . Well , if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's , and if he agrees that both A a B are making appropriate observations a inferences regarding the situation , then I would expect him to conclude that there is no right answer . Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regarding which answer to except . If , on the other hand , he disagrees with the principles of either A or B , I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one . It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives . For instance , I am completely unable to come too any conclusion regarding weather abortion should be aloud or not , from my prospective . In an ideal world , all living things would have and write to life ; but in an ideal world , women would have there absolute write to do what they like with their own bodies . Clearly there is no way to resolve in favour of both these principles . Therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception , and deciding on the time based on various ( sometime ill-defined ) criterion . This is also a sensible move , I think , because it lets people make their own decisions ( within reason ) . a for what it's worth , I am reasonably happy with currant UK abortion law . Similarly , the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess , and I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion . the , I don't even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage . mathew
