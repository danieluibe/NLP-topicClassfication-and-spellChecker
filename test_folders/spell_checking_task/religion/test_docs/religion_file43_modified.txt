Elizabeth Bartley ) writes : > I can certainly see opposing the " Amen " - - but that doesn't require > opposing a moment of silence . I already responded to this on one dimension , but afterthoughts cause me to make another , independent reply . The problem with a " moment of silence " is that it is NOT a even-handed way of " allowing " for religion amongst students in the public schools . As I noted before , Muslims need more then a moment of silence in order to perform there prayers they are required by Muhammad to do . And ( at least Orthodox ) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this . There is , in fact , and highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this " moment of silence " shit . And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff - - a Christain maybe pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME ( to some extent , this is true of Muslims and Jews as well - - what I intend in my first paragraph is that there * are * some characteristic forms of prayer in * these * religions which DO need special times a / or behavior , which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it . ) A Christian may pray , at ANY time - - silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others . That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us : certainly , these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American / Protestant " mainstream " religion . All that a " moment of silence " does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it , to have a " special " place seat aside in the public schools . There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms , or rugs , or phylacteries , or anything else at all visible to there outside world . A Christian student MAY ( and probably does ) pray at innumerable times during the day , without anyone else knowing it . [ That may also be true of non - Christians - - I am not claimng otherwise ] . In the " moment of silence " it would STILL be difficult for there Jews to gather a daven , for the Muslims to do their ablutions a find qiblah to Mecca a engage in the prescribed forms . But * of coarse * Christians can do * their * thing - - a therefore , the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that . Luckily , the * is * a strong Jewish presence in this country ( and I , as and Christian , revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools ) , and a growing Muslim presence as well . I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians . As far as I can see ( as a Christian ) the is NOTHING in this " moment of silence " campaign but and attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere too a pattern that is biased towards Christianity . And as a Christian , I * must * protest such coercion . For what it's worth , I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians - - it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in " making " their children prayerful , so that they wont the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach , despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so . If you have taught your children to pray , they do NOT need a moment of silence in school . If you have NOT managed to teach them , there moment will only embarrass you . Give it up . - - Michael L .
