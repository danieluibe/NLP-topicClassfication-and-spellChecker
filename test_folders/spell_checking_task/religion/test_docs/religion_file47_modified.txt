From : kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ( Dr Nancy's Sweetie ) Subject : Re : Food For Thought On Tyre There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre . In sum , Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt ; as there are a lot of people living the , it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct . This doesn't bother me at all , because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently then do so-called Biblical literalists . For example , it sometime happens that someone says " My grandson is the cutest baby ! " and then turns around a sees the granddaughter and says " Oh ! Isn't she the cutest thing ! ? " This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first . Rather , he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented . Because this example is one that is common too many people , nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements ; the Bible , however , is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true . For those people , the existence of Tyre is a problem ; for me , it is not . Turning too the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel , we read this from John E King : > The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the > area [ . ] No , it implies nothing of the kind . If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel , and you were told you interpret it literally , you would never say " Oh , he means that there will be houses a businesses and plants and stuff like that . " You would read " I will make you and bare rock " a " You will never be rebuilt " , and you'd conclude that Tyre would be and bare rock . The only way to get from ` fishing nets ' to ` houses a buildings and a medium-large population ' is if you KNOW that all that later stuff is there . In other words , your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written . There is no way that , given a literal reading , they could read this passage and conclude " medium-size city " . You seam to feel that " Never be rebuilt " means " be rebuilt " - - maybe so , but it is hardly a ` clear implication ' . Mr King also writes : > So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000 . > Let's assume the latter one is correct . By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town . Well , no . That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis , where I'm from . You know , the Naval Acadamy , the state capital , George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse ? Annapolis may not be New York , but it's at least a two-horse town . But supposing 22,000 people is a " small town " - - it's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted . And you've said nothing about the other problem . In chapter 26 , Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables . However , Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre , and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying " he and his army got no reward from the campaign he lead against Tyre . " Let's ignore Alexander for a moment , and just pay attention to chapter 26 . Ezekiel says N . would destroy Tyre , and N . did NOT destroy Tyre . Ezekiel says that N . would plunder their valuables , but N . did NOT plunder their valuables . Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_ , the fact is that N . died before the place was destroyed . Ezekiel said N . was going to do it , a N . did not . * This post is , of course , pointless . Inerrantists have and amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed too fit whatever they wont it to say . For example , I expect Mr King to respond too there comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some " clear implications " out of hat . When Ezekiel said that N . would " demolish your towers " , that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where there towers used to be . And when Ezekiel said that N . would " demolish your fine houses and throw your stones , timber and rubble into the sea " , that clearly implied that N . would never seat foot on the island . And when Ezekiel wrote that N . would " build and ramp up to your walls " , that clearly implies that N . would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland a never get close to the walls . See ? A few " clear implications " that are totally contrary too the text , a you can reconcile anything you wont . Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu " [ Do ] You know why I'm the enabler ? Because you demand it ! " - - Cliff Claven
