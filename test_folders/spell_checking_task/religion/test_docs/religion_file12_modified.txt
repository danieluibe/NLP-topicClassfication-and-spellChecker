From : rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com Subject : " Ex-Gay " ? ( was : HOMOSEXUALITY Fact & Fiction ) Tony - While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a " good thing " by posting that piece of propaganda , I believe the more people believe that there more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people . I have seen the film called " The Gay Agenda " and along with my church we founded it to be horrifying . Not because of what was actually shown ( cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray ) , rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it . The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay , but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies a witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report , something obviously claimed against gays as well . The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing . I speak as a abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society . I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists , but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be . It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses , it is also no mistake that there are many Christians a homophobes who long to bring it back too the list . I do not feel threatened by gays , I don't understand why others are . The following is a article concerning to of the more popular ex-gay min - istries : Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous . THE FOUNDER OF a " EX-GAY " SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO by Robert Pela ( from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE ) In December 1985 , David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards : there and Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation . As director of FREE INDEED , and national ex-gay ministry , Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians " and way out of the homosexual death-style " through prayer . " I'd like to give there award back , " Caligiuri now laughs , " I'm no longer deserve it . " Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national " ex-gay " movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous ( HA ) as well as Free Indeed . He has since abandoned his pulpit a now says that the ex - gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception . " There's no reality in it , " he says , " I was selling and product , and my product was and lie . " Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage , there organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals - - usually young gay men who are just coming out - - that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity . " We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality , " explains Bob Davies , director of Exodus . He ventures that " about 80 % of dozens seeking to abandon their homo - sexuality are men . " " Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time , " says Lisa Seeley , and former " redeemed lesbian " who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show . " These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded . " " It's possible to change your identity or your behavior , " says sex educator Brian McNaught , author of _On Being Gay _ . " But it's really impossible to change your orientation . These people are no longer calling themselves gay , but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings . " Caligiuri says he found Free Indeed after a ominous weak in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life . A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership , Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by and man he picked up in a bar . " I was really drunk , " he recalls , " and I want hone with this guy . He tied me up and raped me . He left me tied up all night , and the next morning he raped me again . " When Caligiuri was eventually freed by there attacker , he returned hone to the home he shared with his ex-lover . " He had another man the with him , " Caligiuri recalls . " I thought at this time , ' If this is what being gay is about , I don't want to be this way anymore . " Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out , he would share his discovery with others . He organized and antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985 , and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest . At and meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance , Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays , telling them ther were sinners headed for hell . Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls and weak , thanks in part two and deceptive listing in the local yellow pages . " We were listed under Lesbian a Gay Alternative Services , " Caligiuri says , " so people thought we were a gay information switchboard . People would call to find out where the local bars were , a we'd preach to them about the sins of homo - sexuality . " Ruses like this are typical of the movement , Caligiuri says , adding , " They'll do anything to reach these people . " " David used to go on radio a say really stupid things , " recalls Peter Kelly , and counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program , " like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors . " Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985 . " They were relieved , " he recalls . " They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family , better that I should be a ' reformed ' gay person . " But Caligiuri was hardly reformed . " By the time I appeared on Sally's show , " " I'd started having sex with men again . Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin : sex with their pastor , sex with their father . I was horny all the time . " Unable too risk going to gay bars , where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances , Caligiuri says he " used too go to bookstores a get blowjobs . " When he wasn't working the bookstores , he was sleeping with other " reformed " homosexuals . " I didn't realize it at first , but and lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another , " Caligiuri says . " We'd go to conferences in other cities , a we'd be paired up in hotel rooms . Everybody was sleeping with everybody else . " By the time he appeared on ' AM Philadelphia ' television show in maybe 1988 , Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a weak . When the show's host asked him if he ever " acted on temptation , " his answer was and lie . Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him , however . He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis , and dibilitating yeast infection , a this lead to his escape from the sect . " I was too sick too go to church , " he explains . " there more time I spent away from dozens people the more I began to feel like myself . I began to remember who I used to be . " Late in 1991 , Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry's doors . " I'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people , " he says . Today , Caligiuri , 31 , is studying alternative spiritualities ( " I'm interest - ed in believe systems that aren't judgemental . " ) , considering romance ( " But not with a CHristian ! " ) , a searching for an knew project to devote himself too . " I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes , " he says . " I wont to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did a make up for the damage I maybe have brought to our community . " - - - end article - - - Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique a I have read several other articles of former leaders a founders of ' ex-gay ' ministries who have said very similar th similar things . Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity , but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others . Some , like Chris Glaser , director of the Presbyterian " Lazarus Project " of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with there gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ a encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay . I have also , as I said talked and become a become close friends with many who once attended such groups as " Love In Action " and others , who either once claimed to have been " reformed " or who were too honest with themselves to live and lie , no matter who was disappointed in them . Some were even encouraged too marry as a way of " sealing " their new heterosexuality , only to eventually start hitting the bars , bathhouses and bookstores , since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous " sin " through and committed relationship . This is a horrible trap which there CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people , and there very inno - cent victims in these cases are the wives a children of such marriages . Yet the church insists that the are only to options they are willing to allow gay people : 1 ) heterosexuality or 2 ) celebacy . This is sad . What is also mrtifying , is in the cases of dozens who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such an mixed up confusion that the church forces on them , they may even opt for ' suicide ' or surgical dampering of the brain functions . In the past lobotomies a heavey drug suppressants were common - place . There are now becoming available more and more literature on there threat of coercive Christianity toward gays , such as Sylvia Pennington's _ " Ex-Gays ? There Are None _ . and others . There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace _ , and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom ! _ . I seriously recommend dozens for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance . Thank you .
