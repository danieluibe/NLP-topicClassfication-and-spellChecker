Backup lamps on currant models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars . dozens on my Taurus Wagon are quiet bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car , a they're MUCH brighter than dozens on my earlier cars from the 60s a 70s . Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights , look at a ' 92 or ' 93 model ( or perhaps and year or two earlier two ) and you'll see red side marker lamps a white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters . dozens aren't just white reflectors .
