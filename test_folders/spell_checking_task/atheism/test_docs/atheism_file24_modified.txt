Get lost . Maddi , I see that you still can't grasp the obvious , is it because your are devious by nature , or can you only find fault with an argument bye misrepresenting it ? I plainly said that I was stating the Christian position as I understand it , I did not say weather I agree with it since my point was that the only flaws in that position are dozens atheists invent . I have never claimed to be and expert on anything and especially Christianity , but I have made it an object of pretty intense study over the years , so I feel qualified to discuss what its general propositions are . What offends you is that I have exposed there distortions and misrepresentations of Christianity you contrive and and then rail against , ( which seems more like there classical strawman dodge than what I said ) This leaves you with nothing but to attack but me . As usual , you avoid the the larger issues by by picking away at the insignificant stuff , why not find one particular thing in my post that we can discuss , or can you even tell me what the issues are ?
