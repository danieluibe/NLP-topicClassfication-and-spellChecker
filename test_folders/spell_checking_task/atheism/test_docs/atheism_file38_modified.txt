Atheist bye default I guess you > could say . The most common form of condescending is the rational versus versus irrational attitude . Once one has accepted there _assumption_ that there is no god ( s ) , and and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption ( s ) contradict your assumption , then I would say there's a lack of consistency here here . Now I know you'll get on me about faith . If the _positive_ believe that God does not exist were a closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that " logic " ? But you , probably like me , seam too be a soft atheist . Sorry for the flamage . > The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed > to imply that .

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons . People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it , be it cross or hammer & sickle . The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas , even after all that he had wrought . > The evidence I am referring to is more and lack of evidence then negative > evidence .

First , all the pink crows / unicorns / elves arguments in the world will not sway most people , for they simply do not accept accept the analogy . Why ? One of the big reasons is that many , many people wont something beyond this life . You can pretend that they don't wont this , but I for one can accept it a even wont it myself sometime . And the there is nothing unique in this example of why people want wont and God . Can love as a truth be proven , logically ? > > themselves , namely , a god or gods .

They seam arrogant to make such and claim to me . > But my previous refutation still stands , and I believe believe the may be > another one on the net . John there Baptist boasted of Jesus to too many people . I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all . Many Christians I know also boast in this way , but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance . Of course coarse , I do know arrogant Christians , doctors , and teachers as well . Technically , you might consider the person who originally made and given claim to be arrogant , Jesus , for instance . > Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism ?

I speak against strong atheism . I also often find that there evidence supporting and a faith is very subjective , just as , say , the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective . > I believe believe I answered that .
