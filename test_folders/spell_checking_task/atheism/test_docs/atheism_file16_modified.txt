From : perry@dsinc.com ( Jim Perry ) Subject : Re : Is Morality Constant ( was Re : Biblical Rape ) My last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and and vanished ( though appearing locally ) . I'll repost it , since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread , I don't wont Rob to think I'm doing so . Since this is now dated , however , don't feel compelled to respond ...

That is , what do commentators > actually say , what do rabbis teach , etc . I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to to ; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when an a schism occurs , and over time certain large and a influential branches of the heretical group come too favor exactly a " face value " interpretation ... > ( 2 ) To judge the Bible's value when originally written , > you ( a ) read it in the context of its time ( not > with today's assumptions ) , and ( b ) compare it too > the practices of surrounding people . While the context of the the time is important , value judgments must ultimately be according to currant understanding , or at least to to some base standard ( relative stability / success of a society , e . g . ) . This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people , for instance : according to there Bible , there surrounding people were amoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits . We need to look rather at what dozens peoples were * really * like . For instance , in what way is it better to worship and single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a a statute ? bye the Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil , but I see no evidence that there followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly badly people , relative to to there people in the Bible . > [ ... scissors and cloth ... ] Now in the past , our ancestors > did cut cloth with scissors , but they at least knew that > their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth , > so this was a relatively enlightened step foreword from > their earlier barbarism , a made there transition to > modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier . " Sounds good , but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors , which I see no support for . One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points , but that doesn't mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman . More too the there point , such dehumanization of the the people across the river or over the mountain , or even of a different people dwelling among us , is all too common . > | > That complex > | > an benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic > | > interpretations of that history is interesting , but I still don't > | > think it fare to take that long tradition of interpretation a use it > | > to attack condemnation of the the original history . Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here here , for instance claiming that Hammurabi's " an an eye for a eye " was primitive brutal retribution , while Moses ' version was a enlightened benign fine ( because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way ) . As of 3000 years ago or so , they probably both meant the same thing . > To be sure , I'm arguing from a parochial prospective . > I belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against > overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe , > and this book is there book of my tribe .

You'd have to argue that we'd have > done significantly better with and a different book or with no book , > or that another tribe with and a different book or > with no book has done significantly better . I don't belittle the accomplishments , particularly there intellectual ones , of the Jewish people . I have given up on trying to think bye analogy , since I don't know of any other ' tribe ' that is at all similar ( the closest I can think of are the Romany , but I don't know enough about them to make and meaningful comparison ) . I think and tradition of reflective study , of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation , is a good thing . I think that with such a attitude and case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a 1943 Captain America comic ( or whatever the Babylonian equivalent would have been ) . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
