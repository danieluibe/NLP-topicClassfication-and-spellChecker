Mike , I've seen referrences to to " Creation vs Evolution " several times in a . and a I have question . Is either point of view derived from direct observation ; can either be scientific ? I wonder if the whole whole controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the the " Truth " rather then the truth itself . Both sides seem seem to hold too and a philosophical outcome , and I can't help wondering which came first . As I've pointed out elsewhere , my view of human nature makes me belief that there is no way of knowing anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective . So , in the context of a . and , would you take a stand based on what you actually know to be true or on what you want want to be true and how can you tell the difference ? Bill
