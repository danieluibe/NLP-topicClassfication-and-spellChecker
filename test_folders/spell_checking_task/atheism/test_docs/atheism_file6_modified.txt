Your mileage maybe vary . Yes I fully agree with that , but is it " I don't believe gods exist " , or " I believe no gods exist " ? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) pointed out , it all hinges on what you take the the word " believe " to mean . Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and and weak atheism , at least according to there FAQ : # Atheism is characterized bye and absence of belief in the existence of God . # Some atheists go further , and believe believe that God does not exist . The former is # often referred to as there " week atheist " position , a the latter latter as " strong # atheism " . # # It is important to note there difference between these two positions . " Weak # atheism " is simple scepticism ; disbelief in the existence of God . " Strong # atheism " is a a positive belief that God does not exist . Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are " strong atheists " . ( From mathew's " An Introduction to Atheism " version 1.2 last modified 5 - Apr - 93 ) Should the FAQ be clarified to try too pin down this notion of " belief " ?
