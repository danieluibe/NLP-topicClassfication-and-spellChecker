While you never * said * it , the implication is pretty clear . I'm sorry , but I can only respond to to your words , not your true meaning . Usenet is a slippery medium .

I'd be a fool too say that in the large group of people that are atheists , no people exist who wish to proselytize in there same fashion as religion .
