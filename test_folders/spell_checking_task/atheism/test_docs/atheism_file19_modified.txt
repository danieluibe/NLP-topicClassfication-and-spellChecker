I realize immediately that you are not interested in discussion and and are going to thump your babble at me . I would much prefer and an answer from Ms Healy , who seems to have and reasonable and and reasoned approach to things .

Duh , gee , then we must be talking Christian mythology now . I was hoping to discuss something with and reasonable , logical person , but all you seam to have for your side is an a repetition of the the same boring mythology I've seen a thousand times before . I am deleting the rest of your remarks , unless I spot something that approaches and an answer , because they are merely an repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other a contain no thought at all . [ .. ] I have to congratulate you , though , Bill . You wouldn't know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls . Such a and persistent lack of function in the face of repeated attempts to assist you in learning ( which I have seen in this forum a others in the past ) speaks of an talent that goes well beyond my own , meager abilities . I just don't seam to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences . Dean Kaflowitz
