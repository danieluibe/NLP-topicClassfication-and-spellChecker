This is logically bankrupt - - > where is the proof of this nonexistence ? It's a joke . This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i . e . the there believe that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist . This is easily nailed bye showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to to exist , does this mean that we would have to belief in all of them ? According to there above poster , we must believe believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at God ? ( the could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan accept for trivial differences , say one is missing a finger , one has blond hair , ... and they all live on other planets so we can't see them ) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God . > Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the there foot a mock there idea of > a God ? Here again is a classic atheist fallacy . How did they shoot themselves in the foot ? > Radical Muslims , the Crusades , the the Inquisition are common examples that > atheists like to bring up as marks against religion . How weak !

How about the grand-daddy of all human atrocities , > the Stalinist movement ? > Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership , which > proudly featured atheism . There is a big difference here , Stalin didn't say that he stood for a particular moral position ( i . e . against murder a terrorism , etc . ) and and than did the opposite ( like the religious movements ) , he was at least an honest killer . ( This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint ) . Saying that atheism supports murder a violence just because one man was an a tyrant and and an atheist is just badly logic , look at all the russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict your point ? Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people , this is just the there common assumption that atheists can't value life as much as theists ( which you didn't support ) . > Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . Yet > they do in some sense seem seam funny because they believe believe that the existence of God > is unknowable . This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is , > though it's less arrogant and pompous . Ah , and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ . An atheist doesn't have to hold there positive view that god doesn't exist , he / she may maybe just have the the non-existence of the positive belief . Here's there example : Strong atheism - " I believe believe god does not exist " and a positive believe Weak atheism - " I don't belief in a god " and negative believe these are NOT the same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically and atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable . Or let's look at it this way ( in sets ) suppose that a given person has a huge seat of ideas that I will represent as capital letters a these people than either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not . So if S = santa , then E ( S )= no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa . But notice that even E ( S ) = no is itself another idea ! This means you have lots of cases : christian : ( and , E ( A )= yes , B , E ( B )= no , . . . G , E ( G )= yes ... ) where G = god atheist ( strong ) : ( and , E ( A ) . . . . . G , E ( G )= no ) atheist ( weak ) : ( A , ... E ) i . e . no G at all in the seat agnostic : ( and , ... G , E ( G ) = indeterminate , E ' , ... ) > Why are people so afraid to say " undecided " ? It must just be another > feature of human nature - - " undecided " is not an sexy , trendy , or glamorous > word . It does not inspire much hate or conflict . It's not blasphemous . > It's not political . In fact it is too to often taken too mean unsophisticated . Nietzsche once said that an a man would rather will nonexistence then not will at all but there darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to to and maybe may because indecision is not a useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us to to take positions , even false ones . > Bake Timmons , III M .
