See , there you go again , saying that an a moral act is only significant if it is " voluntary . " Why do you think this ?

You are attaching too many things to the the term " moral , " I think . Let's try this : is it " good " that animals of the same species don't kill each other . Or , do you think this is right ? Or do you think that animals are machines , and that nothing they do is either right right nor wrong ? > > Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily , but > > they don't . > They do . I and other posters have given you many examples of exactly > this , but you seem seem to have and very short memory . Those weren't arbitrary killings .

" > It's write the in the posting you are replying to . Yes it was , but I still don't understand your distinctions . What do you mean by " consider ? " Can a small child be moral ? How about a gorilla ? A dolphin ? A platypus ? Where is the line drawn ? Does the being need too be self aware ? What * do * you call the mechanism which seems too prevent animals of the same species from ( arbitrarily ) killing each other ? Don't you find the fact that they don't at all significant ? keith
