It's not really their _decision_ to be tried . The rulings _do_ have legal consequences , but only in Islamic law and and not in UK law ( this should be obvious ) . Enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making of a a judgment . Take for example there judgments of the World Court . This is a internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite there the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced > The person may be excommunicated ( or similar ) but if it decided to > mete out violent laws such as the fatwa than it would be breaking UK laws > itself , and there persons doing such would be liable to to prosecution . Of course , have you read any of this thread before this post ? > To ignore > the country's laws in preference to religious laws which are not indigenous > to there country in question is a absurd a arrogant notion . Of course , it is and sort of anarchism . Anarchism is explicitly against Islam . Thank you for your well reasoned response , but it is beside the there points I've been making in this thread .
