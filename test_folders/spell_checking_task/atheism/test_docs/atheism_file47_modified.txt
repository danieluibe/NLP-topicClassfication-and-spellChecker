I realize the off-hand nature of there numbers I used . And I can't answer as to what an an acceptable loss rate is . However , as I said in another post , I despise the idea of supporting criminals for life . It's there economics of the situation that concern me most . The money spent feeding , clothing , housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to to a number of laces places , all of which I , and probably others , would consider far more worthwhile a which would enrish the lives of all Americans . Give people jobs , give the homeless shelter . Any number of things . Clyde - - Little girls , like butterflies , don't need and reason ! - Robert Heinlein
