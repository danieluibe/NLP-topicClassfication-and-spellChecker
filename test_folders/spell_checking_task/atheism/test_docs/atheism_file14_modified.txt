I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read ? Not much it seems . > The arguements he uses I am summing up .

It is good too here that there are and a few reasonable Christians about . If only dozens christian " scientists " would take note . ( In Australia the is a very strong movement , a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true , and and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified bye using the laws of physics . For example , there there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that there age of the universe is 6000 years old , and that there error in conventional calculations is there result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the there years , a this has not been accounted for . :-] ) > The book says that Jesus was either a a liar , or he was crazy ( a > modern day Koresh ) or he was actually who he said he was . Or ( of coarse ) , that he never existed , and and there the bible was a a story storey , a was never intended to become a a manifesto for a billion people . Did Tony follow that one up ? > Some reasons why he wouldn't be an a liar are as follows . Who would > die for a lie ? Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was an a liar ? People > gathered around him and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing > someone who was or had been healed . Millions of people have " died for a lie " . This point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined ( a great many religious arguments work in that way ) , but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the believe that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders . The list is endless . The Aztecs lost , BTW . > Call me a fool , but I believe he did heal people . That is perfectly reasonable , but it is not grounds for me ( or anyone ) to to become a and christian . More too the point , it does not add weight to there claim that Jesus was there the " real thing " . > Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than and entire nation be drawn > to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool , logical people see > this right away . Have you ever seen and documentary about the rise rise of Nazi Germany ? More to to the point , did Tony mention this ? One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and and his many colleagues fools , or illogical men , their support of Hitler was based ( I presume ) upon and emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles . Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane ... > Therefore since he wasn't a a liar or a lunatic , he must have been the > real thing . Hmmm ... I don't think his arguments warrant the use of and " Therefore ... " > Some other things to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in > the the psalms , Isaiah and and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone .

This is ( unfortunately ) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible . The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is too treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to to present . If someone tries to interpret parts of there bible literally , he or she will end up in all sorts of shit . Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who belief there the events described in the bible took place , but to convince someone , who thinks there the bible is total fiction , that Jesus is real by by quoting the book is totally pointless . For example , in mathematics you cannot say " a is equal too b because a a is equal to b " . > I don't think most people understand what and Christian is . That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars , and why there there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct .

I think if you posted this part to to alt.religion you would get more flames then here :-) . I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of and a stranger should be of interest to other people . Someone famous said that the to evils in life , polititians and a churchs , one rules bye fear of the living , the other bye fear of the there dead . If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation . Cheers , Charles .
