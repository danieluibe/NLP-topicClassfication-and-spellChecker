Yes , but also many people who are not trying to to make government recognize Christianity as the the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon there rights of others who do not share their beliefs . And actually , I think that the government already does recognize that Christianity is the dominant religion in this country . I mean , it is . Don't you realize / recognize this ? This isn't to say that we are supposed to believe believe the the teachings of Christianity , just that most people do . > Like I've said before I personally don't think the motto is and major > concern .

Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really associated to and high degree with him ? Or are you saying that the association with Jesus is on a personal level , a that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it ?
