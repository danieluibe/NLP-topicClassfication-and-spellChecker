I agree , I reckon it's television a the increase in fundamentalism .. You think its the increase in pre-marital sex ... others thinks its because psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system a let violent criminals con them into letting them out into the streets ... others think it's the increase in designer drugs ... others think it's a communist plot .

We just have to hold on to to the there panic handles and a hope that we are heading for a soft landing . But one things for sure , depression a the destruction of there nuclear family is not due solely to sex out of marriage .
